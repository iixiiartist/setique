# Netlify Build Fix: Configuration Parsing Error

## The Problem

The build was failing at the very first step with the error: `Failed to parse configuration`. This indicates a syntax error in the `netlify.toml` file, preventing Netlify from reading its build instructions.

Two specific issues were identified:
1.  The `functions` directory was incorrectly defined under the `[build]` table. It should be specified as `directory` under the `[functions]` table.
2.  An empty `[[redirects]]` block was present at the end of the file, which is invalid TOML syntax.

### Incorrect Configuration

```toml
[build]
  # ...
  functions = "netlify/functions" # Incorrect placement

[functions]
  # Missing the 'directory' key
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  # ...

[[redirects]]
  # ...

[[redirects]] # Invalid empty block
```

## âœ… The Solution

The `netlify.toml` file was corrected to have valid syntax.

### Corrected Configuration

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && cd netlify/functions && npm ci && cd ../.. && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.17.0"
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET", "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY", "VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"]

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions" # Correctly placed here
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["stripe", "@supabase/supabase-js"]

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# The empty [[redirects]] block was removed.
```

These changes ensure Netlify can correctly parse its configuration and proceed with the build.
