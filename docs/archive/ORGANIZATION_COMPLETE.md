## 🔒 Safety Measures

✅ **All changes were safe:**
- Used `git mv` to preserve file history
- No code was modified
- No imports were broken
- All paths are relative
- Git tracked all renames

✅ **Verified:**
- Application still deploys ✅
- All functionality intact ✅
- No broken links ✅
- Documentation updated ✅

## 📖 How to Navigate New Structure

### Finding SQL Scripts

**Old way:**
```
"Where is the admin recursion fix?"
*scrolls through 20+ files in root*
```

**New way:**
```
"Where is the admin recursion fix?"
sql/fixes/fix_admin_recursion.sql ✅
```

**Quick Reference:**
- Need to check database? → `sql/diagnostic/`
- Setting up new environment? → `sql/setup/`
- Fixing a bug? → `sql/fixes/`
- Historical migrations? → `sql/migrations/`
- Managing admins? → `sql/admin/`

### Finding Documentation

**Active Projects:**
- Check `docs/` root folder
- Current guides and checklists

**Completed Milestones:**
- Check `docs/archive/old/`
- Historical documentation

## 📊 Impact
