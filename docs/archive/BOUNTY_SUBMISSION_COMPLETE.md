  .from('bounty_submissions')
  .select('dataset_id')
  .eq('bounty_id', bounty.id)
  .eq('creator_id', user.id)

// Filters out already-submitted datasets
const availableDatasets = userDatasets.filter(
  d => !existingSubmissions.includes(d.id)
)
```

### Approve & Purchase:
```javascript
// Check ownership
const { data: existingPurchase } = await supabase
  .from('purchases')
  .select('id')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('dataset_id', dataset.id)
  .single()

if (existingPurchase) {
  alert('You already own this dataset!')
  return
}

// Update status
await supabase
  .from('bounty_submissions')
  .update({ status: 'approved' })
  .eq('id', submission.id)

// Handle free datasets
if (dataset.price === 0) {
  await supabase.from('purchases').insert([{
    user_id: user.id,
    dataset_id: dataset.id,
    amount: 0,
    status: 'completed'
  }])
  return
}

// Handle paid datasets with Stripe
const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/create-checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ datasetId, userId })
})
const { sessionId } = await response.json()
await stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId })
