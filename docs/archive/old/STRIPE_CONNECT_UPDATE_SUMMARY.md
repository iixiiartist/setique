---

## Technical Changes

### Before (Test Mode):
```javascript
// All payments went to your Stripe account
// You manually split earnings via transfers
stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [{ price: $50 }],
  mode: 'payment',
  metadata: { datasetId, userId }
})
```

### After (Live Mode with Connect):
```javascript
// Direct payment to creator, automatic platform fee
stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [{ price: $50 }],
  mode: 'payment',
  payment_intent_data: {
    application_fee_amount: $10,  // Your 20% ($50 √ó 0.20)
    transfer_data: {
      destination: 'acct_creator123'  // Creator's Stripe account
    }
  },
  metadata: { datasetId, userId, creatorId }
})
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Buyer pays $50
- ‚úÖ Creator receives $40 (80%)
- ‚úÖ You receive $10 (20%)
- ‚úÖ All automatic, no manual transfers needed

---

## Money Flow Comparison

### Old Way (Test Mode):
```
Buyer ‚Üí Stripe ‚Üí Your Account
              ‚Üì
         Manual Transfer ‚Üí Creator Account
              ‚Üì
         Keep Platform Fee
```

**Problems:**
- Manual work to transfer money
- Delayed payouts to creators  
- Complex tax reporting
- More code to maintain

### New Way (Live Mode):
```
Buyer ‚Üí Stripe ‚Üí [Split automatically]
                      ‚Üì               ‚Üì
              Creator (80%)    You (20%)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic, instant split
- ‚úÖ Creators get paid faster
- ‚úÖ Each party gets their own 1099
- ‚úÖ Less code, less maintenance
- ‚úÖ More professional

## Database Impact

No changes needed! The system already tracks:

```sql
-- Creator earnings still recorded the same way
creator_earnings {
  amount: $50.00
  platform_fee: $10.00
  creator_net: $40.00
}

-- Payout accounts work the same
creator_payout_accounts {
  current_balance: $127.50
  total_earned: $450.00
}
```

**The only difference:** Money actually reaches creator's Stripe account immediately instead of being held in platform balance.

## What Creators Need to Do

### First Time Only:
1. Click "Connect Stripe Account" in Dashboard
2. Complete Stripe Express onboarding (5 minutes)
3. Link their bank account
4. Done! ‚úÖ

### After That:
- Sales automatically credited to their balance
- Request payout when balance ‚â• $50
- Money arrives in 2-7 business days

---

## What You Need to Do Now

### One-Time Setup (15 minutes):
Follow the checklist in `STRIPE_LIVE_MODE_CHECKLIST.md`:
1. Get live mode API keys from Stripe
2. Update Netlify environment variables
3. Create live mode webhook
4. Test with a real payment

### Ongoing:
Nothing! The system runs automatically:
- Payments process automatically
- Platform fees collected automatically
- Creator earnings tracked automatically
- Payouts happen when requested

---

## API Keys Needed

### Current (Test Mode):
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_xxxxx (test mode)
```

### After Activation (Live Mode):
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_xxxxx  ‚Üê Change this
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_xxxxx            ‚Üê Change this
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_xxxxx          ‚Üê New webhook secret
```

**Important:** All three need to be from LIVE mode in Stripe Dashboard!

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Mode (Current)
- ‚úÖ Use test cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- ‚úÖ No real money moves
- ‚úÖ Perfect for development

### Phase 2: Live Mode (After Activation)
- Use real credit cards
- Real money transfers
- Start with small test ($1-5)
- Refund test payments if needed

### Phase 3: Production (After Testing)
- Full live operation
- Real customer payments
- Monitor for issues
- Scale up!

---

## Security Notes

### What's Secure:
- ‚úÖ All API keys stored in Netlify (server-side)
- ‚úÖ No secrets in frontend code
- ‚úÖ Webhook signatures verified
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on database
- ‚úÖ Stripe handles all card data (PCI compliant)

### Best Practices:
- Never commit API keys to git
- Never share secret keys
- Rotate keys if exposed
- Use environment variables only
- Test in test mode first

---

## Expected Behavior After Activation

### For Buyers:
- Same checkout experience
- Secure card processing
- Instant download links
- Professional receipts

### For Creators:
- Connect Stripe once
- Automatic earnings tracking
- Request payouts when ready

### For You (Platform Owner):
- Automatic 20% fees collected
- No manual transfer work
- Clean financial reports
- Happy creators = more datasets!

1. In Netlify, swap keys back to `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`
2. Redeploy site
3. Everything works as before
4. Debug in test mode
5. Try live mode again when ready
