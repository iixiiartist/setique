# Demo Dataset Downloads - Customer Experience

## Overview

Demo datasets on Setique provide a **sample README file** instead of actual data files. This gives users a hands-on experience with the platform while clearly explaining that these are demonstration datasets.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Detection**
When a user tries to download a dataset, the system checks if the title contains `(DEMO)`:
```javascript
const isDemoDataset = dataset.title.includes('(DEMO)')
```

### 2. **Sample File Generation**
For demo datasets, instead of retrieving a file from Supabase Storage, the system generates a **customer-facing README file** that includes:

- **Dataset Description**: Full description of what the dataset would contain
- **Schema Information**: Fields and structure (if available)
- **Sample Data**: Example data format (if available)
- **Platform Overview**: How Setique works
- **Call to Action**: Encouraging users to become creators
- **Contact Information**: Support email and website

### 3. **File Delivery**
The README is:
- Encoded as a base64 data URL
- Downloaded directly in the browser
- Named with the dataset title (e.g., `DEMO_Brutalist_Architecture_DEMO_README.txt`)
- No expiration (since it's client-side generated)

### 4. **User Notification**
After download, users see a friendly alert:
```
üìù Demo dataset info downloaded! This is a sample to showcase how Setique works. 
Real datasets include actual data files.
```

## Sample README Content

Here's what a demo dataset README looks like:

```
# (DEMO) A Photographic Archive of Brutalist Architecture in Pittsburgh
## Demo Dataset Sample

Thank you for trying out Setique! üéâ

This is a **DEMO dataset** to showcase our platform's functionality. If this were 
a real dataset purchase, you would receive the actual data files here.

### About This Dataset
400+ high-resolution photos of Pittsburgh's brutalist landmarks, annotated with 
architect, year, and material data.

### What Would Be Included (If Real):

**Data Schema:**
- image_id
- building_name
- architect
- year_built
- materials

**Sample Data Format:**
```
IMG_2025_CMU_WeanHall.jpg, Wean Hall, Yount & Sullivan, 1971, [concrete, steel]
```

**Additional Notes:**
All photos shot professionally in RAW format, available upon request.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (`netlify/functions/generate-download.js`)

```javascript
// Check if demo dataset
const isDemoDataset = dataset.title.includes('(DEMO)')

if (isDemoDataset) {
  // Generate README content
  const readmeContent = `...customer-facing content...`
  
  // Encode as data URL
  const base64Content = Buffer.from(readmeContent).toString('base64')
  const dataUrl = `data:text/plain;base64,${base64Content}`
  
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      downloadUrl: dataUrl,
      fileName: `${dataset.title.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi, '_')}_DEMO_README.txt`,
      isDemo: true
    })
  }
}
```

### Frontend (Success Page & Dashboard)

```javascript
// Handle demo datasets with data URLs
if (data.isDemo && data.downloadUrl.startsWith('data:')) {
  // Create download link
  const link = document.createElement('a')
  link.href = data.downloadUrl
  link.download = data.fileName || 'DEMO_README.txt'
  document.body.appendChild(link)
  link.click()
  document.body.removeChild(link)
  
  alert('üìù Demo dataset info downloaded!')
}
```
