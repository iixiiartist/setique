const [input, setInput] = useState('')                // Current input
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false)       // Typing indicator
```

### Message Flow

```javascript
1. User types message → input state updates
2. User presses Enter/clicks Send → handleSend()
3. User message added to messages array
4. Typing indicator shows
5. Response generated based on intent + context
6. Simulated delay (500-1500ms) for natural feel
7. Assistant message added to messages array
8. Typing indicator hides
9. Auto-scroll to latest message
```
