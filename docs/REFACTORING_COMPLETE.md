# Project Refactoring Complete

## 📋 Summary

Successfully refactored and cleaned up the SETIQUE project structure without breaking any functionality or removing essential files.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Organization
**Created:** `docs/` folder  
**Moved:** 19 documentation files from root to `docs/`
- All troubleshooting guides (NETLIFY_*.md, BUILD_FIX_*.md, etc.)
- All setup guides (SETUP_GUIDE.md, STRIPE_*.md, SUPABASE_*.md, etc.)
- All reference documentation

**Created:** `docs/README.md` - A comprehensive index organizing all documentation by category:
- 🚀 Getting Started
- 🔧 Configuration Guides
- 🚀 Deployment
- 🔨 Build & Troubleshooting Fixes
- 🔒 Security

### 2. Scripts Organization
**Created:** `scripts/` folder  
**Moved:** 3 PowerShell automation scripts
- `setup.ps1`
- `setup-simple.ps1`
- `quickstart.ps1`

### 3. Temporary Files Cleanup
**Removed:**
- `test-connection.html` (was in .gitignore)
- `check-database.js` (was in .gitignore)

These were temporary debugging files that are no longer needed.

### 4. README.md Overhaul
**Updated:** Main README.md with:
- ✨ Project status badges and overview
- 📚 Clear links to organized documentation
- 🏗️ Project structure diagram
- 🎨 Tech stack summary
- 💳 Revenue model details
- 🔒 Security highlights
- 🚀 Simplified deployment instructions
- 📊 Database schema overview
- 🐛 Troubleshooting links

**Removed from README:**
- Verbose step-by-step instructions (now in docs/)
- Duplicate content (consolidated in docs/)
- 130+ lines of detailed setup (now referenced via docs/)
