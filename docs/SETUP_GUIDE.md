3. Open `.env` in a text editor (Notepad works fine)
4. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys:

```env
# From Supabase (Step 2.3)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_very_long_supabase_key_here

# From Stripe (Step 3.3)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# Leave this for now, we'll set it up later
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_placeholder
```

5. Save and close the file

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"

- Make sure your `.env` file exists (for local)
- Make sure you added all environment variables in Netlify (for production)
- Restart your dev server after changing `.env`

### Can't sign in

- Check your email for the verification link
- Make sure you clicked the verification link
- Try resetting your password in Supabase Auth settings

### Payment doesn't work

- Make sure you're using test mode in Stripe
- Check that your webhook is set up correctly
- Use the test card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242

### Site shows error after deploy

- Check the Netlify deploy logs for errors
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Check that your Supabase database migrations ran successfully

## Need Help?

- Check the main README.md for detailed documentation
- Review Netlify deploy logs for specific errors
- Check Stripe webhook logs to see if webhooks are being received
- Check Supabase logs for database errors

## Next Steps

1. **Custom domain**: Add your own domain in Netlify settings
2. **Email templates**: Customize auth emails in Supabase
