# 💰 Payment Flow & Data Delivery Guide

## 🔄 How Payments Currently Work

### The Current Payment Flow (Phase 1 - Basic):

```
1. BUYER clicks "Buy Now" on dataset
   ↓
2. CREATE CHECKOUT SESSION
   - Netlify Function creates Stripe checkout
   - Records "pending" purchase in database
   ↓
3. BUYER pays on Stripe's secure page
   ↓
4. STRIPE WEBHOOK fires when payment succeeds
   - Updates purchase status to "completed"
   - Increments dataset purchase_count
   ↓
5. BUYER redirected to success page
   ↓
6. MONEY GOES TO: Your Stripe account (platform owner)
```

### 🚨 Important: Money Currently Goes to YOU (Platform Owner)

**Right now, all payments go to your Stripe account.** This is the simplest setup and works for:
- Testing the marketplace
- Taking a 100% commission temporarily
- Simple platforms where you handle payouts manually

## 📊 Current Database Schema

Your `datasets` table has fields for file delivery:

```sql
CREATE TABLE datasets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  creator_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  title TEXT,
  price NUMERIC(10,2),
  download_url TEXT,        -- 👈 URL to downloadable file
  file_size BIGINT,         -- 👈 File size in bytes
  purchase_count INTEGER,   -- 👈 Tracks total purchases
  ...
)
```

Your `purchases` table tracks who bought what:

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),      -- 👈 Buyer
  dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id),   -- 👈 What they bought
  amount NUMERIC(10,2),                      -- 👈 Price paid
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',             -- 👈 Payment status
  stripe_session_id TEXT,                    -- 👈 Links to Stripe
  purchased_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## 📦 How Data Delivery Should Work (3 Options)

### Option 1: Direct Download Links (Simplest - Current Setup)

**How it works:**
1. Creator uploads dataset to cloud storage (Supabase Storage, S3, etc.)
2. Creator gets permanent download URL
3. Creator enters URL in `download_url` field when creating dataset
4. After purchase, buyer can access the URL

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ No backend code needed
- ✅ Works with any file host

**Cons:**
- ❌ URLs can be shared (security risk)
- ❌ No download tracking
- ❌ No expiring links

**Best for:** Testing, small datasets, trusted communities

---

### Option 2: Supabase Storage with Signed URLs (Recommended)

**How it works:**
1. Creator uploads file directly to Supabase Storage
2. File stored privately (not publicly accessible)
3. After purchase, generate temporary signed URL (expires in 1 hour)
4. Buyer downloads using signed URL

**Implementation:** I can add this feature! Would need:
- Supabase Storage bucket setup
- Upload UI component for creators
- Signed URL generation after purchase
- Download button for buyers

**Pros:**
- ✅ Secure (URLs expire)
- ✅ Integrated with existing Supabase setup
- ✅ No separate storage service needed
- ✅ Can track downloads

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Supabase has storage limits (1GB free, then paid)
- ⚠️ Need to handle large file uploads

**Best for:** Most marketplaces, secure delivery

---

### Option 3: Third-Party Storage (S3, Google Cloud, Dropbox)

**How it works:**
1. Creator uploads to S3/GCS/Dropbox
2. Store file key/path in database
3. Generate presigned URLs on purchase
4. Buyer downloads from cloud provider

**Pros:**
- ✅ Scalable for large files
- ✅ Very reliable
- ✅ Can use existing storage

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex setup
- ⚠️ Need separate service credentials
- ⚠️ Additional cost

**Best for:** Large datasets (>100MB), high-volume platforms

## 💸 How Creator Payouts Should Work (3 Options)

### Option 1: Manual Payouts (Current - Simplest)

**How it works:**
1. All money goes to your Stripe account
2. You manually track creator earnings
3. You send payouts via Stripe, PayPal, or bank transfer

**Setup:** Already working!

**Pros:**
- ✅ No additional code needed
- ✅ You control everything
- ✅ Can review transactions

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual work for you
- ❌ Slow for creators
- ❌ Not scalable

**Best for:** Testing, small number of creators

---

### Option 2: Scheduled Payouts (Recommended)

**How it works:**
1. Track creator earnings in database
2. Run weekly/monthly payout script
3. Automatically pay creators via Stripe Transfers
4. Deduct your platform fee (e.g., 20%)

**Example:**
- Dataset sells for $50
- Creator gets: $40 (80%)
- You keep: $10 (20% platform fee)

**Implementation needed:**
- Add `creator_earnings` table to track balances
- Add platform fee percentage to config
- Create payout Netlify Function
- Use Stripe Connect or Transfers API

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automated payouts
- ✅ Creators get paid regularly
- ✅ You take a platform fee
- ✅ Scalable

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires additional coding
- ⚠️ Need to handle failed payouts
- ⚠️ Tax reporting considerations

**Best for:** Growing marketplaces with multiple creators

---

### Option 3: Stripe Connect (Most Professional)

**How it works:**
1. Creators create their own Stripe accounts
2. Link their accounts to your platform (Stripe Connect)
3. Payments split automatically:
   - Creator gets their share instantly
   - You get platform fee automatically
4. Each creator gets their own Stripe Dashboard

**Example:**
- Buyer pays $50 for dataset
- Stripe automatically sends:
  - $40 to creator's Stripe account
  - $10 to your platform account

**Implementation needed:**
- Set up Stripe Connect (Express or Standard)
- Add "Connect Stripe Account" flow for creators
- Update payment flow to use connected accounts
- Handle onboarding and account verification

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automated
- ✅ Instant payouts to creators
- ✅ Stripe handles all tax forms (1099s)
- ✅ Each creator has own dashboard
- ✅ Most professional solution

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex setup
- ⚠️ Creators must complete Stripe onboarding
- ⚠️ Additional Stripe fees

**Best for:** Professional marketplaces, many creators

## 💡 What You Should Do Right Now

### For Testing (Minimum Viable Product):

1. **Keep current setup:**
   - Payments → Your Stripe account ✅
   - Manual data delivery via URLs ✅

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Create a dataset with Google Drive link
   - Buy your own dataset (test card)
   - Verify purchase appears in database
   - Test that URL works

3. **For creators:**
   - Tell them to upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
   - Get shareable link
   - Paste link when creating dataset

### For Production (Professional Platform):

1. **Implement Supabase Storage** (I can help!)
2. **Set up Stripe Connect** for creator payouts
3. **Add download tracking and limits**
4. **Create creator dashboard** to track earnings

---

## 📋 Creator Payout Tracking (Manual Method)

Want to track who earned what? Run this query in Supabase:

```sql
-- See creator earnings
SELECT 
  p.username as creator,
  d.title as dataset,
  COUNT(pur.id) as total_sales,
  SUM(pur.amount) as total_revenue,
  SUM(pur.amount) * 0.8 as creator_earnings_80_percent,
  SUM(pur.amount) * 0.2 as platform_fee_20_percent
FROM purchases pur
JOIN datasets d ON pur.dataset_id = d.id
JOIN profiles p ON d.creator_id = p.id
WHERE pur.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY p.username, d.title
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

This shows:
- Each creator's sales
- Revenue per dataset
- Your platform fee (20% example)
- Creator's earnings (80%)
