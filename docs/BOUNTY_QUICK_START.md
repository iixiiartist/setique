## FAQs

**Q: Can I submit multiple datasets to the same bounty?**  
A: Yes, but you can only submit each dataset once per bounty.

**Q: What happens after I approve a submission?**  
A: You'll be charged for the dataset (if not free), it'll be added to your library, and the submission status changes to "Approved".

**Q: Can I edit my submission after submitting?**  
A: Not currently. Create a new submission if needed (but can't resubmit same dataset).

**Q: Do I get paid immediately when someone approves my submission?**  
A: Payments process through Stripe Connect. Check the "Earnings" tab in your dashboard.

**Q: Can I see who submitted datasets to my bounty?**  
A: Yes, in the "My Bounties" tab, expand submissions to see creator usernames.

**Q: What if I already own a dataset someone submitted?**  
A: The system checks ownership before purchase and won't let you buy it again.
