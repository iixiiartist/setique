## ‚ùå **MISSING FEATURES** (Still on Roadmap)

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Next Up)

#### 1. **Comments System** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Users cannot discuss datasets in threaded conversations

**What's Missing**:
- No comment threads on dataset pages
- No replies to comments
- No edit/delete functionality
- No moderation tools

**Database Needed**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dataset_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_comment_id UUID REFERENCES dataset_comments(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  edited BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
**ROI**: High - drives engagement and community
**Priority**: HIGH - The last major social feature needed

**Components Needed**:
- DatasetComments.jsx (main component) - ‚úÖ EXISTS but needs update
- CommentItem.jsx (individual comment)
- CommentForm.jsx (add/edit form)
- CommentThread.jsx (nested replies)

**Integration Points**:
- Add to DatasetsPage dataset detail modal - ‚úÖ Already has Comments tab!
- Notification triggers for comment_added - ‚úÖ Already exists
- Activity feed integration - ‚úÖ Already exists
- Moderation queue for admins

**Note**: Comments tab already exists in dataset modal, just needs enhancement for replies/threading

---

#### 2. **Review Moderation Tools** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Need to handle spam/abuse in reviews

**What's Missing**:
- No flag/report functionality for reviews
- No admin review moderation queue
- No automated spam detection

**Database Needed**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE review_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  review_id UUID REFERENCES dataset_reviews(id),
  reporter_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**ROI**: Medium - needed for trust & safety

---

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Phase 3)

#### 3. **Enhanced Discovery Algorithms** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**What's Missing**:
- No "Recommended for you" based on follows/favorites
- No "Popular with people you follow"
- No personalized trending algorithm

**Implementation**:
- Build recommendation engine using:
  - User's favorite tags
  - Followed users' activities
  - Network clustering
  - Collaborative filtering
- Add "Recommended" section to DatasetsPage
- Create DiscoveryFeedPage with personalized content

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**ROI**: Medium - improves discovery but requires user base

---

#### 4. **Comment Moderation Tools** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**What's Missing**:
- No flag/report functionality for comments
- No automated spam detection
- No user blocking
- No rate limiting

**Components Needed**:
- Report modal for comments
- Admin comment moderation queue
- User blocking system
- Spam detection algorithm

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
**ROI**: Medium - needed once comments launch

---

### **LOW PRIORITY** (Future/Phase 4)

#### 5. **Direct Messaging** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Why Low**: Complex, moderation intensive, wait for user base

**What's Needed**:
- Real-time chat infrastructure
- Message threads database
- UI for inbox/conversations
- Moderation tools for abuse
- Block/report functionality

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 days
**ROI**: Low initially - can wait

---

#### 6. **Collaborative Features** ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Why Low**: Edge case, requires permission system overhaul

**What's Needed**:
- Team/organization accounts
- Dataset co-ownership
- Permission management system
- Invitation system

**Estimated Effort**: 15+ days
**ROI**: Low - wait for demand

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Priority (Next 1-2 weeks):**

**Option A: Comments Threading/Polish** (Recommended)
- **Week 1**: Enhance existing comments system
  - Add threaded replies (parent_comment_id support)
  - Improve CommentItem component for nesting
  - Add edit/delete functionality
  - Add real-time updates
- **Week 2**: Moderation & Polish
  - Flag/report system
  - Admin moderation queue
  - Rate limiting
  - Testing and deploy

**Option B: Review Moderation**
- Build review reporting system
- Admin moderation dashboard
- Spam detection

**Recommendation**: Do **Comments Threading** First
- Comments system already exists, just needs enhancement
- Reviews are complete and working well
- Threading/replies will make comments much more valuable
- Can add review moderation in parallel

---

### **Medium-Term (1 month):**

1. **Add Review Moderation** (if did Comments first)
   - Flag/report for reviews
   - Admin review moderation
   - Spam detection

2. **Build Advanced Comment Features**
   - Mentions (@username)
   - Rich text formatting
   - Image attachments (optional)

3. **Enhance Discovery**
   - Recommendation algorithms
   - Personalized feeds
   - "Popular with your network"

---

## üìä **Current Metrics to Track**

### **Social Engagement** (Already Live)
- Follow rate: % users following ‚â•1 person
- Average follows per user
- Activity feed views
- Favorite rate per dataset
- Notification open rate
- Share button clicks

### **After Comments Launch** (Future)
- Comments per dataset
- Reply rate
- Comment depth (threading)
- Time to first comment
- Daily active commenters

### **After Reviews Launch** (Future)
- Review completion rate
- Average rating distribution
- Reviews per dataset
- Helpful vote engagement
- Verified vs non-verified review ratio

---

## üö® **Critical Gaps Analysis**

### **1. Comments Need Threading Enhancement** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current State**: Basic comments exist but no threaded replies
**Missing**: Parent/child comment relationships, nested display
**Impact**: Discussions feel flat, less engaging
**Solution**: Add threading support (1-2 weeks)

### **2. Moderation Tools Needed** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current State**: No moderation for comments or reviews
**Missing**: Flag, report, hide, delete tools for admins
**Impact**: Risk of spam/abuse in user-generated content
**Solution**: Build moderation dashboard (2-3 weeks)

### **3. Discovery Still Basic** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current State**: Search + browse only
**Missing**: Personalized recommendations
**Impact**: Users miss relevant datasets
**Solution**: Build recommendation engine (Phase 3)

---

## üí° **Architecture Review**

### **What's Working Well** ‚úÖ

1. **Activity Tracking System** - Clean, extensible
   - Central activityTracking.js library
   - Consistent logging across all actions
   - Easy to add new activity types

2. **Notification System** - Modern, real-time
   - RPC functions for security
   - Supabase Realtime for instant updates
   - Clean separation of concerns

3. **Component Architecture** - Reusable, maintainable
   - Modal-based patterns (FeedbackModal, ShareModal)
   - Service layer (notificationService.js)
   - Clear prop interfaces

### **Areas for Improvement** üîß

1. **Need Comment/Review Infrastructure**
   - Should mirror notification pattern
   - commentService.js for all comment operations
   - reviewService.js for rating/review logic

2. **Consider Caching Strategy**
   - As activity feed grows, queries will slow
   - Consider Redis for hot data (trending, notifications)
   - Materialized views for complex queries

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent spam comments/reviews
   - Throttle API calls
   - Supabase Edge Functions for rate limiting
