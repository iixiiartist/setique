## ❌ **MISSING FEATURES** (Still on Roadmap)

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Next Up)

#### 1. **Comments System** ❌ NOT STARTED
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Users cannot discuss datasets

**What's Missing**:
- No comment threads on dataset pages
- No replies to comments
- No edit/delete functionality
- No moderation tools

**Database Needed**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dataset_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_comment_id UUID REFERENCES dataset_comments(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  edited BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
**ROI**: High - drives engagement and community

**Components Needed**:
- DatasetComments.jsx (main component)
- CommentItem.jsx (individual comment)
- CommentForm.jsx (add/edit form)
- CommentThread.jsx (nested replies)

**Integration Points**:
- Add to DatasetsPage dataset detail modal
- Notification triggers for comment_added
- Activity feed integration
- Moderation queue for admins

---

#### 2. **Reviews & Ratings System** ❌ NOT STARTED
**Impact**: HIGH - No quality feedback mechanism

**What's Missing**:
- No star ratings on datasets
- No written reviews
- No "verified purchase" badges
- No helpful/unhelpful voting

**Database Needed**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dataset_reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  review_text TEXT,
  helpful_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(dataset_id, user_id) -- One review per dataset per user
);

-- Add to datasets table
ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN average_rating DECIMAL(2,1) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN review_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Estimated Effort**: 5-6 days
**ROI**: Very High - builds trust and helps discovery

**Components Needed**:
- DatasetReviews.jsx (review list)
- ReviewForm.jsx (add review)
- StarRating.jsx (rating component)
- ReviewCard.jsx (individual review)

**Integration Points**:
- Dataset detail modal
- Dataset cards (show average rating)
- User purchase verification
- Notification triggers for review_added
- Activity feed integration

---

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Phase 3)

#### 3. **Enhanced Discovery Algorithms** ❌ NOT STARTED
**What's Missing**:
- No "Recommended for you" based on follows/favorites
- No "Popular with people you follow"
- No personalized trending algorithm

**Implementation**:
- Build recommendation engine using:
  - User's favorite tags
  - Followed users' activities
  - Network clustering
  - Collaborative filtering
- Add "Recommended" section to DatasetsPage
- Create DiscoveryFeedPage with personalized content

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**ROI**: Medium - improves discovery but requires user base

---

#### 4. **Comment Moderation Tools** ❌ NOT STARTED
**What's Missing**:
- No flag/report functionality for comments
- No automated spam detection
- No user blocking
- No rate limiting

**Components Needed**:
- Report modal for comments
- Admin comment moderation queue
- User blocking system
- Spam detection algorithm

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
**ROI**: Medium - needed once comments launch

---

### **LOW PRIORITY** (Future/Phase 4)

#### 5. **Direct Messaging** ❌ NOT STARTED
**Why Low**: Complex, moderation intensive, wait for user base

**What's Needed**:
- Real-time chat infrastructure
- Message threads database
- UI for inbox/conversations
- Moderation tools for abuse
- Block/report functionality

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 days
**ROI**: Low initially - can wait

---

#### 6. **Collaborative Features** ❌ NOT STARTED
**Why Low**: Edge case, requires permission system overhaul

**What's Needed**:
- Team/organization accounts
- Dataset co-ownership
- Permission management system
- Invitation system

**Estimated Effort**: 15+ days
**ROI**: Low - wait for demand

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Priority (Next 2-3 weeks):**

**Option A: Comments First** (Recommended)
- **Week 1-2**: Build comments system
  - Database migration
  - Comment components
  - Integration with dataset pages
  - Notification triggers
  - Activity feed integration
- **Week 3**: Polish, test, deploy

**Option B: Reviews First**
- **Week 1**: Build star rating system
  - Database migration
  - Rating components
  - Average calculation triggers
- **Week 2**: Add written reviews
  - Review form and list
  - Verified purchase badges
- **Week 3**: Helpful voting, polish, deploy

**Recommendation**: Do **Comments First**
- More engaging (ongoing discussions vs one-time reviews)
- Higher viral coefficient (comments spark more comments)
- Builds community faster
- Can add reviews after (reviews can include comments)

---

### **Medium-Term (1-2 months):**

1. **Add Reviews System** (if did Comments first)
   - Simple 5-star ratings
   - Optional text reviews
   - Verified purchase badges

2. **Build Comment Moderation**
   - Flag/report system
   - Admin moderation queue
   - User blocking

3. **Enhance Discovery**
   - Recommendation algorithms
   - Personalized feeds
   - "Popular with your network"

---

## 📊 **Current Metrics to Track**

### **Social Engagement** (Already Live)
- Follow rate: % users following ≥1 person
- Average follows per user
- Activity feed views
- Favorite rate per dataset
- Notification open rate
- Share button clicks

### **After Comments Launch** (Future)
- Comments per dataset
- Reply rate
- Comment depth (threading)
- Time to first comment
- Daily active commenters

### **After Reviews Launch** (Future)
- Review completion rate
- Average rating distribution
- Reviews per dataset
- Helpful vote engagement
- Verified vs non-verified review ratio

---

## 🚨 **Critical Gaps Analysis**

### **1. Dataset Interaction Still Limited** ⚠️
**Current State**: Users can only buy, favorite, and share
**Missing**: Comments and reviews = no rich discussion
**Impact**: Lower engagement, less community feel
**Solution**: Prioritize comments (2-3 weeks)

### **2. Moderation Tools Needed** ⚠️
**Current State**: No comment/review moderation yet
**Missing**: Flag, report, hide, delete tools
**Impact**: Risk of spam/abuse when comments launch
**Solution**: Build moderation tools in parallel with comments

### **3. Discovery Still Basic** ⚠️
**Current State**: Search + browse only
**Missing**: Personalized recommendations
**Impact**: Users miss relevant datasets
**Solution**: Build recommendation engine (Phase 3)

## 💡 **Architecture Review**

### **What's Working Well** ✅

1. **Activity Tracking System** - Clean, extensible
   - Central activityTracking.js library
   - Consistent logging across all actions
   - Easy to add new activity types

2. **Notification System** - Modern, real-time
   - RPC functions for security
   - Supabase Realtime for instant updates
   - Clean separation of concerns

3. **Component Architecture** - Reusable, maintainable
   - Modal-based patterns (FeedbackModal, ShareModal)
   - Service layer (notificationService.js)
   - Clear prop interfaces

### **Areas for Improvement** 🔧

1. **Need Comment/Review Infrastructure**
   - Should mirror notification pattern
   - commentService.js for all comment operations
   - reviewService.js for rating/review logic

2. **Consider Caching Strategy**
   - As activity feed grows, queries will slow
   - Consider Redis for hot data (trending, notifications)
   - Materialized views for complex queries

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent spam comments/reviews
   - Throttle API calls
   - Supabase Edge Functions for rate limiting

5. ✅ Social sharing
6. ✅ User discovery
7. ✅ Trust levels
8. ✅ Feedback system

### **Next Up** (Complete Phase 2)
1. 🎯 **Comments system** (2-3 weeks)
2. 🎯 **Reviews & ratings** (2-3 weeks)
3. 🎯 **Moderation tools** (1-2 weeks)
