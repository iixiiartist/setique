## 🔒 Access Control Verification

### Route Protection Status:
| Route | Access Level | Beta Required | Auth Required | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| `/` | Public | No | No | ✅ |
| `/datasets` | Public* | Yes† | No | ✅ |
| `/bounties` | Public* | Yes† | No | ✅ |
| `/marketplace` | Public | No | No | ✅ |
| `/dashboard` | Protected | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| `/settings` | Protected | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| `/moderation` | Protected | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| `/feed` | Protected | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| `/notifications` | Protected | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| `/admin` | Protected | No‡ | Yes | ✅ |
| `/profile/:username` | Public | No | No | ✅ |
| `/discover` | Public | No | No | ✅ |

**Notes:**
- *Public = Pages load without authentication
- †Beta Required = Actions (purchase/submit) require beta access, shown as locked state
- ‡Admin has role-based access control instead of beta requirement

### Beta Access Implementation:
Both new pages implement beta access checking via:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('has_beta_access', {
  user_id_param: user.id
})
```

**Beta User Experience:**
- ✅ Full access to all features
- ✅ Can browse, purchase, favorite, share datasets
- ✅ Can view, submit proposals to bounties
- ✅ Normal navigation and CTAs

**Non-Beta User Experience:**
- ✅ Can view page structure
- ✅ Sees "Beta Access Required" locked state
- ✅ Datasets/bounties cards show with lock icons
- ✅ "Sign Up for Beta Access" CTA displayed
- ✅ Cannot perform transactions

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

**None** - All functionality working as expected.

**Minor Note:**
- User must still run SQL migration for notifications:
  ```bash
  # Run in Supabase SQL Editor
  sql/migrations/20251012_notifications_system.sql
  ```
- Notifications will show 404 errors until migration is run
- This does not affect datasets or bounties functionality

---

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why Public Routes?
- **Discovery:** New users can browse datasets/bounties before signing up
- **SEO:** Public pages get indexed by search engines
- **Conversion:** See value proposition before committing
- **Beta Gate:** Actions still require beta access via conditional rendering

### Why Separate Pages Instead of Tabs?
- **SEO:** Each page has its own URL and meta tags
- **Performance:** Smaller bundle size per page
- **Navigation:** Browser history and bookmarkable URLs
- **Analytics:** Better tracking per section
- **Scalability:** Easier to add features per page

### Why Dynamic Meta Tags Instead of React Helmet?
- **Simplicity:** No additional dependencies
- **Performance:** useEffect is lightweight
- **Compatibility:** Works with any React version
- **Cleanup:** Auto-restore defaults on unmount
