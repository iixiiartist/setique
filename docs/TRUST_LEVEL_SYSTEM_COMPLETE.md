# Trust Level System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Complete implementation of automatic trust level progression system with admin management UI and public profile badges.

## Implementation Date
January 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/021_trust_level_auto_progression.sql`)

**Auto-Progression Function:**
- `check_and_upgrade_trust_level(user_id)` - Automatically upgrades trust levels based on approved dataset count
- Level 1 (Verified): 3+ approved datasets
- Level 2 (Trusted): 10+ approved datasets
- Records all changes to trust_level_history table

**Trigger System:**
- `trigger_trust_level_check()` - Fires after dataset moderation_status changes to 'approved'
- Automatically checks and upgrades user trust level when datasets are approved

**History Tracking:**
- New `trust_level_history` table with:
  - user_id, previous_level, new_level, reason, changed_by
  - created_at timestamp for audit trail

**Admin Override:**
- `admin_set_trust_level()` RPC function for manual trust level changes
- Accepts: user_id, new_level, reason
- Records who made the change and why

**Initial Migration:**
- Runs trust level check on all existing users
- Upgrades eligible users based on current approved dataset counts

### 2. Admin Management UI (`src/components/TrustLevelManager.jsx`)

**Features:**
- Current trust level display with color-coded badge
- Progress tracking to next level (shows X/3 or X/10 approved datasets)
- Progress bar showing percentage to next level
- Manual override buttons (Set Level 0/1/2/3)
- Trust level history viewer with pagination
- Distinguishes between automatic and manual changes
- Real-time data fetching with React hooks

**Integration:**
- Used in AdminDashboard.jsx
- Replaces old manual moderation access controls
- Calls admin_set_trust_level RPC function

### 3. Trust Level Badge Component (`src/components/TrustLevelBadge.jsx`)

**Features:**
- Color-coded badges for each level:
  - Level 0 (New): Gray badge with üÜï emoji
  - Level 1 (Verified): Green badge with ‚úÖ emoji
  - Level 2 (Trusted): Blue badge with ‚≠ê emoji
  - Level 3 (Moderator): Purple badge with üëë emoji
- Size variants: sm, md, lg
- Tooltips on hover with level descriptions
- Reusable across all pages

**Integration:**
- UserProfilePage: Next to display name (md size)
- DashboardPage: Next to "Welcome back" message (md size)
- ActivityFeedPage: Next to actor name in feed items (sm size)
- UserDiscoveryPage: On user cards in both grid and list views (sm size)

## Trust Level Definitions

| Level | Name | Requirements | Badge | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | New | Default | üÜï Gray | New creator, datasets require manual review |
| 1 | Verified | 3+ approved datasets | ‚úÖ Green | Verified creator, established track record |
| 2 | Trusted | 10+ approved datasets | ‚≠ê Blue | Trusted creator, high-quality contributions |
| 3 | Moderator | Admin assigned | üëë Purple | Moderator/admin with special permissions |

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. `supabase/migrations/021_trust_level_auto_progression.sql` (147 lines)
2. `src/components/TrustLevelManager.jsx` (210 lines)
3. `src/components/TrustLevelBadge.jsx` (39 lines)

### Modified Files
1. `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Integrated TrustLevelManager component
2. `src/pages/UserProfilePage.jsx` - Added trust badge next to profile name
3. `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` - Added trust badge in welcome section
4. `src/pages/ActivityFeedPage.jsx` - Added trust_level to data queries and badge to feed items
5. `src/pages/UserDiscoveryPage.jsx` - Added trust_level to data queries and badges to user cards

## Testing Checklist

### Database Functions
- [ ] Run migration successfully: `npm run supabase:migration:up`
- [ ] Verify check_and_upgrade_trust_level function exists
- [ ] Verify trigger_trust_level_check function exists
- [ ] Verify trust_level_history table created
- [ ] Verify admin_set_trust_level RPC function exists
- [ ] Test initial trust level check runs on all users

### Automatic Progression
- [ ] Create test user with 0 approved datasets (should be level 0)
- [ ] Approve 3rd dataset, verify auto-upgrade to level 1
- [ ] Approve 10th dataset, verify auto-upgrade to level 2
- [ ] Verify trust_level_history records automatic changes
- [ ] Verify trigger fires on dataset approval status change

### Manual Admin Controls
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Navigate to Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Open TrustLevelManager for a user
- [ ] Verify current level displays correctly
- [ ] Verify approved dataset count is accurate
- [ ] Test manual level override buttons
- [ ] Verify trust_level_history records manual changes with reason
- [ ] Verify changed_by field shows admin username

### Badge Display
- [ ] UserProfilePage: Badge shows next to username
- [ ] DashboardPage: Badge shows in welcome section
- [ ] ActivityFeedPage: Badges show on activity items
- [ ] UserDiscoveryPage: Badges show on user cards (both views)
- [ ] Verify all 4 badge levels display with correct colors/emojis
- [ ] Verify tooltip descriptions show on hover
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile screens

### Edge Cases
- [ ] User with no datasets (level 0)
- [ ] User deleted/unpublished datasets (verify count accuracy)
- [ ] Admin downgrading trust level (should work)
- [ ] Multiple rapid dataset approvals (trigger should handle)
- [ ] User has level 3 (moderator) - auto-progression should not downgrade

## Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment:**
   ```powershell
   # Verify build succeeds
   npm run build
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   ```

2. **Commit changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Implement automatic trust level progression system with admin UI and profile badges"
   git push
   ```

3. **Post-deployment:**
   - Monitor migration execution in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify trust_level_history table populated
   - Check initial trust level upgrades applied
   - Test admin UI on production
   - Verify badges display on all pages

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Visible reputation**: Trust badges show creator credibility
- **Automatic recognition**: No manual action needed to level up
- **Transparent progression**: Clear path from New ‚Üí Verified ‚Üí Trusted

### For Admins
- **Reduced manual work**: Auto-progression handles most upgrades
- **Full control**: Manual override available when needed
- **Complete audit trail**: History shows who changed what and when

### For Platform
- **Improved trust**: Users can quickly assess creator reliability
- **Scalable moderation**: Trust levels enable tiered review processes
- **Community growth**: Gamification encourages quality contributions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notifications:**
   - Notify users when they level up
   - Show progress in user dashboard

2. **Perks by Level:**
   - Level 1: Faster review times
   - Level 2: Auto-publish without review
   - Level 3: Moderation permissions

3. **Public Leaderboards:**
   - Showcase top trusted creators
   - Monthly featured creators

4. **Advanced Metrics:**
   - Track average time to each level
   - Analyze correlation with dataset quality
   - Monitor abuse/gaming of system

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback steps:

1. **Disable trigger:**
   ```sql
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_dataset_moderation_check_trust_level ON datasets;
   ```

2. **Remove components from UI:**
   - Comment out TrustLevelBadge imports/usage
   - Restore old moderation controls in AdminDashboard

3. **Revert migration:**
   ```powershell
   npm run supabase:migration:down
   ```
