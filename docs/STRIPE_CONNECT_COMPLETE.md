# Stripe Connect Configuration Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

Stripe Connect is now fully configured for creators to receive payouts! Here's what was added:

### 1. **Frontend Integration (DashboardPage)**
- ✅ "Connect Stripe Account" button in the Earnings tab
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Automatic detection of onboarding completion
- ✅ Success/error feedback messages

### 2. **Backend Functions**
- ✅ `connect-onboarding.js` - Creates Stripe Connect Express accounts
- ✅ Generates onboarding links for identity verification
- ✅ Stores account details in `creator_payout_accounts` table

### 3. **Webhook Integration**
- ✅ `stripe-webhook.js` updated to handle `account.updated` events
- ✅ Automatically tracks account status (incomplete → active)
- ✅ Monitors `payouts_enabled` and `charges_enabled` capabilities

### 4. **Database Updates**
- ✅ Added `charges_enabled` column to `creator_payout_accounts`
- ✅ Migration file: `005_add_charges_enabled.sql`

## How It Works

### For Creators (Sellers):
1. User creates a dataset and makes a sale
2. Earnings appear in Dashboard → Earnings tab
3. Click "Connect Stripe Account" button
4. Redirected to Stripe onboarding:
   - Verify identity with government ID
   - Add bank account details
   - Agree to Stripe Connect terms
5. Redirected back to dashboard with success message
6. Status updated to "Active" with payouts enabled ✅

### Technical Flow:
```
User clicks "Connect Stripe Account"
    ↓
DashboardPage → handleConnectStripe()
    ↓
POST /.netlify/functions/connect-onboarding
    ↓
Create Stripe Express Account
    ↓
Generate Account Link (onboarding URL)
    ↓
Save to creator_payout_accounts table
    ↓
Redirect user to Stripe hosted onboarding
    ↓
User completes verification
    ↓
Stripe sends webhook: account.updated
    ↓
Update account_status, payouts_enabled, charges_enabled
    ↓
Redirect back to /dashboard?tab=earnings&onboarding=complete
    ↓
Show success message ✅
```

## Required Configuration

### Netlify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (or sk_test_ for testing)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... (for elevated permissions)
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup

1. **Enable Stripe Connect**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect
   - Enable "Express accounts"
   - Set branding (logo, colors, business name)

2. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Add webhook endpoint: `https://setique.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
   - Select events:
     - `checkout.session.completed` (existing)
     - `account.updated` (NEW - for Connect status tracking)
   - Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. **Platform Settings**
   - Review payout schedule (default: daily)
   - Set minimum payout threshold (currently $50)
   - Configure transfer destination

## Database Migration

Run the new migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Execute: supabase/migrations/005_add_charges_enabled.sql

ALTER TABLE creator_payout_accounts
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS charges_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

UPDATE creator_payout_accounts
SET charges_enabled = payouts_enabled
WHERE charges_enabled IS NULL;
```

## Testing Stripe Connect

### Test Mode Flow:
1. Sign in as a creator who has made earnings
2. Go to Dashboard → Earnings tab
3. Click "Connect Stripe Account"
4. Use Stripe test data:
   - Test phone: +1 000-000-0000
   - Test SSN: 000-00-0000
   - Test DOB: 01/01/1901
   - Test bank: routing 110000000, account 000123456789
5. Complete onboarding
6. Verify status updates to "Active"

### Verify Integration:
- Check `creator_payout_accounts` table for new record
- Confirm `onboarding_completed = true`
- Confirm `payouts_enabled = true`
- Check Stripe Dashboard → Connect → Accounts for new Express account

## What Happens Next

Once a creator's Stripe account is connected:
1. **Automatic Earnings Tracking**: All sales are recorded in `creator_earnings`
2. **Balance Updates**: `current_balance` increases with each sale (minus 20% platform fee)
3. **Payout Eligibility**: When balance ≥ $50, "Request Payout" button appears
4. **Future Enhancement**: Implement `request-payout.js` function to transfer funds
