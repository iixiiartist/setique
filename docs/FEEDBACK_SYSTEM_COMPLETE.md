## User Flow

### For Users:

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment:
```bash
# Build and verify
npm run build

# Check migration syntax
cat supabase/migrations/022_feedback_system.sql
```

### Post-Deployment:
1. Monitor migration execution in Supabase
2. Verify table created successfully
3. Test user submission on live site
4. Test admin interface accessibility
5. Announce new feedback system to users

### Rollback Plan:
If issues arise:
```sql
-- Drop table and related objects
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_feedback CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_feedback_updated_at() CASCADE;
```

Revert code changes:
```bash
git revert 8746937
git push
```
