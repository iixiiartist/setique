You'll apply through your Dashboard (Pro Curator tab), browse curation requests from dataset owners, and submit proposals for projects you can help with. When accepted, you earn 40% of all future sales from that dataset.

As you complete projects, you'll earn badges:
üîµ Verified (starting out)
üü£ Expert (10+ projects, 4.5+ stars)
üü° Master (50+ projects, 4.8+ stars)

The cool part? You get ongoing passive income. Every time that dataset sells, you get paid. If a dataset sells for $100, you earn $40, the creator gets $40, and we take $20.

Head to your Dashboard ‚Üí Pro Curator tab to apply. Takes about 5 minutes to fill out. Ready to get started?`

You pick the curator you like best, they do the work, and then you split revenue 50/50 on your 80% share. So if your dataset sells for $100: you get $40, your curator gets $40, platform gets $20.

Why partner with a curator?
- Professional data cleaning and formatting
- Better metadata = higher prices
- Share the work, keep earning together
- Their reputation helps your dataset sell

To post a request, go to Dashboard ‚Üí "Request Curation Help" button. Takes a few minutes to describe what you need.

If you want to be a curator: Earn 40% of ongoing sales from datasets you help improve

The basics:
- Clean out duplicates and handle missing values properly
- Structure it consistently (same format throughout)
- Add good metadata so people know what they're getting
- Write clear documentation explaining your schema

For presentation:
- Use descriptive titles that actually explain what's in there
- Write compelling descriptions with real use cases
- Tag it properly so buyers can find it
- Be honest about the modality (vision, audio, text, etc.)

Think of it like being a librarian but for AI training data. The better organized and labeled your data is, the more valuable it becomes.

Start by researching similar datasets to see what's out there. Look at data quality, uniqueness, and how much demand there is.

My advice? Start with a free demo dataset ($0) to showcase your quality and build trust. Once people see what you can do, they'll be more willing to pay for your premium stuff.

For pricing your full datasets:
- Factor in collection effort and how fresh the data is
- Consider complexity and size
- Adjust based on uniqueness (rare data = premium prices)
- Don't undersell yourself, but also don't price yourself out

A good strategy: Offer a free 10-20 sample pack, then price the full collection based on value. You can always adjust based on buyer feedback.

Got a specific dataset in mind? Tell me more and I can give you a pricing range.`

Set a realistic budget. Higher bounties attract better quality data. And use clear language - you want creators to understand exactly what you're looking for.

To post one: Click "Post a Bounty" on the homepage, fill in the details, and you're live. Then go to Dashboard ‚Üí My Bounties to review submissions. When you find data you like, approve it and you'll automatically purchase it.

Ready to post? What kind of data are you looking for?`

Price competitively but don't undervalue your work. Only submit high-quality, relevant stuff. You can submit multiple datasets to one bounty if they're all relevant.

To submit: Find a bounty, click "Submit Your Dataset," select your dataset, add your pitch notes. Track everything in Dashboard ‚Üí My Submissions.

‚è≥ Pending = they're reviewing it
‚úì Approved = congrats, they bought it!

For pricing, I'd say research similar datasets first. For your first few, consider making them free or cheap to build trust and showcase quality. You can always upload premium versions later.

Make your description pop - explain what's in it, why it's useful, what problems it solves. Think about it from a buyer's perspective: why should they care?

Your title should be searchable and specific. "Cat photos" is generic. "High-res photos of 50 cat breeds in natural poses" tells people exactly what you've got.
