## 📍 Netlify Dashboard
To monitor the deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Look for the **setique** project
3. Check the "Deploys" tab for build status
4. Deployment should complete in 2-5 minutes

### Expected Build Output
```
Building site...
✓ Installing dependencies
✓ Running npm run build
✓ Building Vite project
✓ Optimizing bundle
✓ Deploy successful!
```

## 🎯 What to Check After Deployment

### 1. Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] Login works correctly
- [ ] All 10 tabs load and switch smoothly
- [ ] Dataset management works
- [ ] Bounty creation works
- [ ] Stripe Connect works
- [ ] Earnings display correctly

### 2. Performance
- [ ] Initial page load is fast (1.5-2s)
- [ ] Tab switching is instant (cached data)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. Caching Behavior
- [ ] Data loads from cache on repeat visits
- [ ] Cache invalidates after mutations
- [ ] Fresh data loads after TTL expires

## 🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS

If deployment is successful, you should see:
- ✅ Netlify build status: "Published"
- ✅ Site loads without errors
- ✅ Dashboard is significantly faster
- ✅ All features working as before
- ✅ Smooth user experience

---

## 📞 If Issues Occur

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Check Logs
1. Netlify Dashboard → Deploys → Latest Deploy → Deploy Log
2. Browser Console (F12) for frontend errors
3. Netlify Functions log for backend errors

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Build fails**: Check Node version (should be 20.17.0)
- **Runtime errors**: Check environment variables in Netlify
- **Slow performance**: Check if caching is working (Network tab)
